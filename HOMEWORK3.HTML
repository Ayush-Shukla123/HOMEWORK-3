    <li>Making the pizza sauce</li>
    <li>Assembling the pizza</li>
</ol>
<b><h3>Let's start with step-1 making the pizza bread:-</h3></b>
<section>
<ol>
    <li>Dissolve the sugar in warm water and add dry active yeast to it.</li>
    <li>stir the whole mixture and keep it aside for 10-15 min.</li>
    <li>when the yeast is getting doubled up,Take a cuo of folur with salt in a bowl.Mix well.Add olive oil.</li>
    <li>After 10-15 min the yeast will bubble and you will see a good frothy layer on top</li>
    <li>Now add the frothy yeast mixture to the flour.With a whisk or wooden spoon stir the mixture.</li>
    <li>Add another cup of flour nd keep on string.</li>
    <li>The mixture will become sticky.</li>
    <li>Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir.</li>
    <Li>the dough will leave the sides of the bowl bu still will be a bit sticky.</Li>
    <li>It is time now to knead the dough with the hand.Knead the dough to a smooth dough.Dust with flour to prevent sticking
        The dough will be soft and elastic .Apply some olive oil to the dough all around.
    </li>
    <li>keep the dough in a deep large bowl and cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel for 1.5 to 2 hours.</li>
    <li>After 2 hours the doughhas beatifully risen and doubled up to what you see below.</li>
    <li>i had planned to make the pizza the next day.so i wrapped the dough tightly in a cling film and kept in the fidge
        if you plan to make the pizza right away then flatten the dough to a disk. then start rolling the dough.
    </li>
    <li>The next morning i removed the pizza dough from the fridge and if you compare the two pics,the dough was getting leavend even in the fridge.</li>
    <li>I kept the cold pizza dough at room temperature for about 45 min. before  i started assembling and rolling pizza.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<b><h3>step-2 Making pizza sauce</h3></b>
<ol>
    <section>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degree C.Grease the baking pan with olive oil & then dust it with maize flour,semolina
        or flour.
    </li>
    <li>Take a large ball from the dough.I made three medium-sized pizzas from this dough. You can use the whole 
        dough to make an extra-large pizza or even make two large pizzas.</li>
        <li>place the pizza base in the baking pan.Be careful as the dough has so much elasticity.
            Do this work of placing very gently.brush the surface with olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the tomato pizza sauce on the pizza</li>
        <li>Top-up with the veggies and olives.</li>
        <li>top with some shredded mozarella cheese or pizza cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 10-15min at 200'C </li>
